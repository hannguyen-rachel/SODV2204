        <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans</p>

        <h2>Corona virus</h2>
        <p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. </p>
        <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Cough</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Breathing difficulties</li>
        </ul>
